# Pokemon Battler

## Intro
This is a functional two-player pokemon battle game that can be played within the terminal as seen in this example:


## Setup Instructions
- To play the game or view the repo first fork and clone the repo. 
- Open the cloned version in your preferred text editor.
- Run `npm install` to setup all required dependencies.
- Open your text editor's terminal and run `node battle.js`
- The game should begin within your terminal, follow the instructions provided in that terminal to play. 

## Further Plans
Currently the game is setup with 5 initial Pokemon. In future plans, I want to include more Pokemon for users to choose from, as well as more Pokemon types. 

I also want to implement 1-Player functionality so a user can battle against the computer.
